# Changelog

## v0.0.1 (June 16 2021)

### Feature

1. Written in `TypeScript`, providing complete type support.
2. Modify the names of some `props` to provide more semantic `props`.
3. Smaller package size. (This has nothing to do with me, it is all the credit of `Vue`)
4. More incomplete documentation and Demo presentation. (Currently part of the document is copied from the original author, and the Demo presentation uses the original author and will be added immediately)

## v0.0.2 (June 25 2021)

### Feature

1. The `d.ts` files are merged into one file, making the unpacked size smaller.
2. Now you can use `app.use()` to register the component globally, or import it inside the component for partial registration.
3. More complete documentation, more detailed tutorial.
4. Still no Demo. (Will be added in the next release)
